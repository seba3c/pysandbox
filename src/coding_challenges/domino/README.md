# Domino

"Domino": We are given an S string, representing a domino tile chain.
Each tile has an L-R format, where L and R are numbers from the 1..6 range.
The tiles are separated by a comma.

Some examples of a valid S chain are:
* `"4-3,5-1,2-2,1-3,4-4"`
* `"1-1,3-5,5-2,2-3,2-4"`

Devise a function that given an S string, returns the number of tiles in the longest
matching group within S. A matching group is a set of tiles that match and that are subsequents in S.

Domino tiles match, if the right side of a tile is the same as the left side of the following tile.
"2-4,4-1" are matching tiles, but "5-2,1-6" are not.

```
domino("1-1,3-5,5-2,2-3,2-4") # should return 3.
```
